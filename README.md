# Python Crash Course (A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming) by Eric Matthes

This repository will be my home where I read through and complete projects from the title above. The 'src' directory will contain python files where I work through the chapters creating small programs initially, but then larger programs as the book progresses into the later chapters.
